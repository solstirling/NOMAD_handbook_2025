# Pocketing Table

## Pocketing Reference Table

| Component                     | Pocket? (Y/N) | Reason                                                                |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drivetrain boxtube            | **No**        | Weight down low is good for CG.                                       |           
| Bellypan / Brainpan           | **Yes**       | Large flat area, makes wire routing easier.                           |
| Low-down plates (elev frame)  | **Maybe**     | Could lower CG, but not always worth the effort.                      |
| Top elev plates               | **Yes**       | Important to save weight higher up; keep MOI and CG low.              |
| Elevator boxtubes             | **Maybe**     | Pocketing removes mounting locations; easier to use thinner box tube. |
| UTB intake plates             | **Yes**       | Partial depth pockets with thick ribs save weight effectively.        |
| End effector plates           | **Yes**       | Same reasons: save weight, reduce inertia (MOI), keep CG low.         |
| Polycarb Plates               | **No**        | Already lightweight; better to leave unpocketed for strength.         |
