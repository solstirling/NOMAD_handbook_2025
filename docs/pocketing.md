# __Pocketing__

Pocketing is removing any uneccesary material from a plate, tube, or panel, and leaves the __ribs__ , which keep the essential structure strong and rigid. Whether you are trying to make the year's weight limit, or lighten up a mechanism, pocketing is a great solution. 

Before actually going over the pocketing process itself, there are a few important things to know:

## Before you pocket:

1. __Finish the design.__ Especially in Onshape, where you have multiple people working with you, pocketing too early can turn into messy workflow. When designing plates, so many aspects change in order to avoid interferences and clipping, the pocketing will just break and give you a hard time, so always finish the design first, and then pocket.

2. __Do you need to pocket it?__ In some situations, like over the bumper intakes, it may be better to switch to a lighter, flexible material such as polycarb instead of pocketed metal. In other situations, such as structural gussets and plates, it may be better to leave it unpocketed to keep all of the structure you can.
